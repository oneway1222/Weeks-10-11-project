## Background: 



A **honeypot** is a decoy application, server, or other networked resource that intentionally exposes insecure features which, when exploited by an attacker, will reveal information about the methods, tools, and possibly even the identity of that attacker. Honeypots are commonly used by security researchers to understand the threat landscape facing developers and system administrators, collecting data that might include:







* Information about sources of malicious network traffic such as IP addresses, geographic origin, targeted ports, etc.



* Information used to harden resources against email spammers



* Malware samples



* DB vulnerabilities such as SQLI techniques







* Summary of the Attacks
